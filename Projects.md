## Welcome to the Projects Page!
Below are a few assignments and projects that I've worked on while in college.

#### Conversational Sentiment Analysis
During my experience at Intuit Mailchimp, I was able to work with two teamates to research conversational sentiment analysis. You can view our paper here(link coming soon). I was also able to create a working demo of our concept to present and you can view it on Github [here](https://github.com/amhpeeler/Python-Sentiment-Analysis-Chat-App). 

#### Georgia Tech Inventory Project
While interning at Georgia Tech, a group of interns and I worked on a system to simplify inventoring Georgia Tech products. You can view that project on Github [here] (https://github.com/amhpeeler/gtInventoryApp).
