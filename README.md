Extracurricular Activites

During my time in college, I've been able to use my spare time for some extracurriculars that have helped me in many ways! For one, I was able to serve as the Community Service Chair for CSU's National Society of Leadership and Success (NSLS) branch. In that role I oversaw the many projects that the club was doing around the community, my favorite being the annual "Safe Halloween" that takes place in Morrow, Ga! At the Safe Halloween, CSU's NSLS branch is priveledged to give out candy and serve the local kids of Morrow for an evening.

On top of everything, I was able to start a Bible study club on campus! "Truth Talk" was born out of a desire to see Jesus' name be shared and talked about at Clayton State, and I'm proud to be a part of such an initiative. Overseeing Truth Talk has consisted of planning and organizing weekly Bible studies, monthly worship nights, and facilitating outreach at CSU's orientation events.
