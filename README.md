#Welcome to my project portfolio! 

###About Me:

_Hi!_ My name is Anna Marie Tinsley!

I am graduating in May 2024 from Clayton State University with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I have a passion for starting projects, helping other people achieve their goals, and evaluating solutions! I love working with Python, Databases, and SQL and am currently looking for work in software development or data engineering!


###My Experience:

######Launchpad Academy
While at Clayton State, I have had the privilege of being a part of the Launchpad Academy which involves closely working with Intuit Mailchimp and gaining real world experience in different technical aspects of a business. We were part of a semester long bootcamp where we learned more about Quality Assurance, API Core, Automated Testing, Cybersecurity, Front-End Development, Cloud Computing, etc. While in this program, we completed a project on conversational sentiment analysis that was presented and the paper is being reviewed for publishing. Over the course of the semester, we were also partnered with a Intuit Mailchimp employee who provided us with advice, career guidance, and project feedback.

######Internship at Georgia Tech
I am currently interning at Georgia Institute of Technology in the Mechanical Engineering department gaining valuable skills in database creation and management, device management, Python, networking, and device troubleshooting and repair. I am currently working on a project with the Invention Studio and the team of interns to create an augmented reality system.
