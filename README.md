Hi!

Welcome to my project portfolio! 

**About Me!**
I am graduating in May 2024 from Clayton State University with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science! While here, I have had the privilege of being a part of the Launchpad Academy which involves closely working with Intuit Mailchimp and gaining real world experience in different technical aspects of a business. 

I am currently interning at Georgia Institute of Technology in the Mechanical Engineering department gaining valuable skills in database creation and management, device management, Python, networking, and device troubleshooting and repair. I am currently working on a project with the Invention Studio and the team of interns to create an augmented reality system.
